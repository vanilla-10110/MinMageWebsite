				<h1 class="titles">Swords and Spells</h1>
                <p>Journey through an ancient dungeon filled with dangerous monsters, treacherous traps, and powerful magic. As a skilled adventurer hired by the king himself, your mission is to explore this mysterious labyrinth and retrieve an ancient artifact of great value.

Whether you choose to wield a mighty sword or cast powerful spells, you must use all your skills and cunning to survive in this perilous environment.
                    
                    But beware, the dungeon is full of unexpected twists and turns, and each playthrough will offer a new and challenging experience. With permadeath and procedurally generated levels, every decision you make could be your last, making each victory all the more satisfying.
                    
                    So gather your courage, sharpen your blades, and prepare for an unforgettable adventure into the depths of the unknown. Will you emerge victorious with the ancient artifact, or will you fall to the horrors that lie within? The fate of the kingdom rests in your hands in Swords and Spells.</p>
